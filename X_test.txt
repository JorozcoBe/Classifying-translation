The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic
I think that now you should present an amended draft directive incorporating these further measures this waiting period and use your role to put pressure on the Council rather than falling in line as a measure of precaution with the lowest common denominator in our respective governments
Any assurance that you can give the House that action could be taken if this is discovered to be true would be gratefully received
In any case it is not the place of the Community to decide or even suggest that regional and local authorities should play a greater part or participate otherwise in a given European decision making process as indicated in the Napolitano report
There is nothing about protecting the interests of the hapless innocent citizen who might get caught up in the nightmare of a Europol investigation

Finally with regard to the earlier answer to a question from my colleague Mrs Kinnock about our obligations under the Cotonou Agreement to extend market access for ACP countries in terms of the trade negotiations does this not fly in the face of those promises and call into question our commitment to development in those countries

We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while at the same time promoting growth within our economies
The second front on which we should expect short term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa
From this experience I have come to believe that in spite of the fact that the rapporteurs and the Commission have taken a number of points into account what is being proposed today still presents serious dangers
For our part we will reject many amendments that we do basically agree with but that would make it difficult to adopt the final text
Also in this field there are acquired rights which it would be unfair to modify in a backdated fashion
Despite the efforts of the new Member States which were prepared to make many concessions during the Summit the budgetary debate did not result in unqualified success

This has to be a benefit in what we call rip off Britain by driving down high prices in our own over priced internal home market

These organisations in fact pay for membership of EWL and they do not have permanent financial aid available to them
We have stressed that when a system of stranded costs is specified this may in principle involve a public aid operation and therefore the Commission must at least be able to check whether this aid is in accordance with the stranded costs

This is part of a wider strategy to internalise the external costs of transport in all modes to get transport prices right

In conclusion a simple first step would be for the EU and specifically eurozone Member States to have a sustainable debt maturity strategy as the absolute debt level at this time is less important than the amount of debt which is up for renewal

However when it comes to agencies which have independent income the system set out by Mr Kellett Bowman which was approved unanimously except for one vote by the Committee on Budgets and broadly by this Parliament is highly unsatisfactory because it actually ends up giving the power of discharge to the administrative council of the agencies concerned which would be justified but only gives firstly a simple power of opinion to this Parliament
But that question has not been raised
That is why the MEDIA programme which was presented in July 2004 has been provided with a budget of over EUR 1 billion

The first is this since this directive was first proposed the whole furore across the European Union because of events in Austria and elsewhere where the extreme right has come forward has caused us as a Parliament with the widest possible across party support to work with the Council and the Commission to agree an accelerated timetable to enable this directive to go through to provide the strongest possible response to the racist and extremist threats that undermine our combined values
The first thing that I would like to say is that the 1993 directive on working conditions is quite inadequate and leaves room for all sorts of excesses
Peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks have met with repression more common to an Arab than to a European country from an 18 year old regime which has slowly stifled hope of progress

That split conceals another the first group includes the supporters of a great federalist leap forward and realists who are beginning to wonder if a totally integrated Europe economically and politically really amounts to the correct solution faced with enlargement and the democratic deficit
The Council has to explain to the House why it made these changes

You can provide state aids that are untouchable even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself
author Mr President here we are again examining the sticking plaster and wondering if it is large enough and strong enough to cover the wound
As you can tell we are gradually moving towards this new policy and I think that between us the Commission the Council and Parliament we should ensure that this annual report on the application of the Charter which I will submit on behalf of the Commission and which Parliament will criticise or approve is a great moment of truth and an opportunity to take a close look at matters
