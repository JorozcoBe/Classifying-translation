We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while at the same time promoting growth within our economies
The second front on which we should expect short term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa

This is part of a wider strategy to internalise the external costs of transport in all modes to get transport prices right

In conclusion a simple first step would be for the EU and specifically eurozone Member States to have a sustainable debt maturity strategy as the absolute debt level at this time is less important than the amount of debt which is up for renewal

However when it comes to agencies which have independent income the system set out by Mr Kellett Bowman which was approved unanimously except for one vote by the Committee on Budgets and broadly by this Parliament is highly unsatisfactory because it actually ends up giving the power of discharge to the administrative council of the agencies concerned which would be justified but only gives firstly a simple power of opinion to this Parliament

The first thing that I would like to say is that the 1993 directive on working conditions is quite inadequate and leaves room for all sorts of excesses
Peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks have met with repression more common to an Arab than to a European country from an 18 year old regime which has slowly stifled hope of progress
