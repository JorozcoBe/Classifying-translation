This is a Deep Learning Challenge project where the task is, given English sentences, make a classifier
that tries to predict whether the given sentence is an original English text or a human translation from
French into English. 
The data provided consists of transcribed English Speech. Some of the sentences were originally uttered 
in English (label 0), others were originally uttered in French and then translated by a human translator 
into English (label 1).
X_data file contains the English sentences and y_data file contains the labels for every sentence.
A test set (X_test) file does not have labels. 

The idea of the project is about design the entire pipeline of a Deep Learning project. There is a 
word file that tries to summarize the approach my classmates and I followed to predict the category 
of interest.
